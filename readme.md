# This app doesn't work anymore
You can take a look at another one right there [github](https://github.com/nowakowsky/Pokerstars-Api)




## Run software.py after running PokerStars game.

#### Working features:
#####    -> Recon cards on table
#####    -> Recon game stage
#####    -> Recon player's cards
#####    -> Recon player's turn
#####    -> Recon possible moves
#####    -> Gives you tight-aggressive rating.

#### Example output:
    Cards on table: S8 H7 ST
    Game stage: Floop
    Player cards: D9 HA
    Tight-agressive rating: trash
    Possible moves: raise fold call

**This project has been made to learn some python basics, it's far from being perfect. Sorry!**

Update. If anything in PokerStars GUI has changed it won't work anymore.
